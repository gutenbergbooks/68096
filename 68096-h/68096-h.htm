<p>That portion of the public which honors me by
perusing what I have been fortunate enough to
learn concerning the future of the inhabitants of
this planet, half a century from this Christmas
of 1892, will naturally, as my name is unknown
to either fame or science, wonder on what
grounds I presume on so bold an undertaking;
perhaps what manner of man I might be.</p>

<p>But when I positively disclaim any merit or
virtue as a prophet, and state that I am merely
by chance the medium by which a portion of the
veil is torn from the future, it is enough that I
describe myself, as referred to in sundry recitals,
as Francis Ainsworth, of the City and
County of New York. Perhaps I might add that
I am by choice an electrician, by birth a Pennsylvanian,
in age twenty-one, and by no fault of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
my own still unmarried. For some years I have
been endeavoring to save enough to enable me to
marry my lifelong friend Estelle Morton, of Philadelphia;
but as I have a family of small sisters
to support out of my salary and what I can earn
by extra work, the period of our engagement has
been prolonged beyond the time of even our least
sanguine calculations. Nearly all my evenings
are spent at home, within the sound of the Jefferson
Market clock; for I have chosen the Ninth
Ward because it is even yet an American stronghold,
because it is convenient to my place of business,
and because it is better than it looks, which
is preferable to looking better than facts warrant.</p>

<p>Once a month, however, I am sure to be at the
meeting of my Masonic lodge in the Temple, at
Twenty-third Street; for I feel that there I am in
contact with both the living present and the
dead past; and the Mystic Tie seems well worth
critical study.</p>

<p>One evening as I was about to enter the side
portal on the Avenue, a ragged newsboy offered,
at more than the regular price, some “extras”
containing an account of some great financial
upheaval in Europe. The man by my side objected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
to paying an exorbitant price for the
hastily-issued and noisily-cried sheet, saying to
his companion: “Now, if he would bring me to-morrow’s
news, Trask, I wouldn’t mind paying a
good round sum for it.” The auburn-haired Past
Master, who is seamed with the scars of battle in
“The Street,” replied, more in earnest than in
jest: “I would readily pay a thousand dollars
for a knowledge for what will happen to-morrow,
and a million if it were exclusive.” “On
that basis,” said a man ahead, who was just stepping
into the elevator, “what would it be worth
to know what is to happen fifty years hence?”
“Oh,” said Trask, “I suppose it would be reasonably
safe to offer any price at all for the performance
of an impossibility; and for that matter,
any one impossibility is just as unreasonable
to ask as any other. It’s hard enough to be
sure of what happened fifty years ago, let
alone diving into the news of fifty years hence.”</p>

<p>“It is not so impossible as you think,” quietly
remarked a gentleman at my side, who seemed
a stranger to all of the rest. “It can be done,
if one has patience, judgment, time and
means.”</p>

<p>As we meet all sorts of people in the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
at large, it is not unreasonable to expect a fair
variety among Free Masons, who, while held
to a uniform belief in certain things, and to unvarying
actions in others, have the freest living,
compatible with a charitable and upright walk,
in all others; consequently, even so radical a remark
as that, and even one so gravely uttered,
exacted no comment, and scarcely a glance
from any, other than one of courteous recognition
that the speaker had addressed his companions.</p>

<p>He was a distinguished looking man, even in
a Masonic temple, where men of commanding
presence, men of dignified bearing, men of venerable
appearance and men of philosophical
habit, are by no means uncommon. Although
but of medium height, his carriage was
such as to give him the appearance of a tall
man. His eyes were dark, full, luminous, and
wide apart; the nose strong, straight and with
large nostrils; the mouth small, firm and flexible.
A still luxuriant head of wavy white hair,
long white mustaches, and beard falling full
and untrimmed upon his breast, imparted a distinguished
and venerable appearance. His
erect form was slender although evidently well-muscled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
even at his age, which seemed seventy
or thereabouts. His dress was neat and inconspicuous;
the materials evidently of excellent
quality, although of a fashion long gone
out of date.</p>

<p>We entered the lodge-room almost together,
and like myself, he took a seat near the door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To the work for this evening there was lent
unusual interest by the presence of a Masonic
celebrity, revered in two hemispheres, who had
been invited to give us the benefit of the stores
of learning for the possession of which he was
noted, and of the wise counsel which he ever
gave to those younger and less well-informed in
Masonic matters.</p>

<p>The eloquent speaker having held us spell-bound
by his masterful presentation of the
teachings of symbolic Masonry, in a flight of
oratory carried us back to the days and works
of Solomon the King, of Hiram Abiff, and of
that other Hiram, King of Tyre; and in the first
great Temple which those early Master Masons
builded twenty-nine centuries previously, traced
for us, in form, size and position of timber and
metal—in tool, and time, and work, noble lessons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of manhood and virtue; of brotherhood
and helpfulness; of contemplation and self-restraint,
until each one addressed felt that he,
too, was proud of being a Free and Accepted
Master Mason, and emulous of being a credit to
his ancient craft.</p>

<p>In the building of that majestic, beauteous,
mystic Temple,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent2">“No hammers fell, no ponderous axes rung;</div>
<div class="verse">Like some tall palm the mystic fabric sprung.</div>
<div class="verse">Majestic silence!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>His descriptive powers, his witching imageries,
held us spell-bound. But at one point the
speaker paused, saying that here there seemed
to be something well worth knowing, but which
the centuries had hidden. It was evidently replete
with symbolism of highest order; but the
key to its mysteries was unfortunately lost.
Some day, perhaps, the light of investigation
might penetrate the gloom in which the mystery
was enwrapped—if, indeed, those better
versed in the craft had not already solved the
interesting problem.</p>

<p>The point referred to was one of those in
which occult ratio and mystic beauty of proportion
unfold on every hand new virtuous teachings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
It was so rich in reminder and suggestion,
no matter from what side viewed, that its
consideration roused the enthusiasm of all hearers.</p>

<p>When the speaker ceased, the quiet little gentleman
next me seemed as one filled with inspiration.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent11">“... With grave</div>
<div class="verse">Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed</div>
<div class="verse">A pillar of state; deep on his front engraven</div>
<div class="verse">Deliberation sat.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>In a well-modulated voice which had evidently
been one of great power and beauty, he
asked permission to endeavor to cast some light,
however feeble, upon so interesting a subject.
Something in the quiet dignity of his bearing,
in the classic precision of his diction, and the
graceful modulation of his voice, attracted all
with more than usual force to the new speaker.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent11">“... his look</div>
<div class="verse">Drew audience and attention still as night</div>
<div class="verse">Or Summer’s noontide air.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>He said that in order to find the fullest measure
of symbolism in this, as in other Temple
mysteries, we must go further than the Temple
walls and question the inner chambers of the
pyramids—we must ask of the Shepherd Kings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
what Solomon and the two Hirams told them
not. The point was beautifully elucidated both
in itself and in its relation to others, so that its
increased richness of allusion and teaching became
at once surprisingly manifest.</p>

<p>Evidently all present felt that a master of the
mysteries of the buried centuries was among us—and
in gesture and expression all asked “the
old man eloquent” to continue, and to give his
views upon the work of those Shepherd Kings
to whom he had so appositely alluded.</p>

<p>So far as I can remember the facts which he
laid before us, and fill up gaps in my memory,
by reference to standard authorities, he spoke
as follows:—</p>

<p>“The Hykshos or Shepherd Kings came suddenly
into this land of mystery; came with a
purpose, which purpose accomplished, they departed
speedily. That purpose, for which they
travelled so far, was to build the great pyramid,
a unique, symbolic, and prophetic structure,
‘star-y-pointing,’ raised on a site chosen from the
whole surface of the earth by reason of its
unique, its solitary fitness. That building, type
of the ever-during gates of heaven, wonderfully
symbolized the mystic wisdom of its time; imperishably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
recorded the principal facts in metrology,
meteorology and astronomy, and prophetically
embodied the discoveries of ages then
to come. Temple and town have gone to the
ground, but it has endured. It was the precursor
of the great symbolic Temple of Solomon,
built by the descendants of those shepherd
builders, students of the heaven’s wide pathless
way, and which although destroyed, could
be reconstructed by the measures and dimensions
familiar to our mystic craft, and recorded
in that great book of symbols, the Bible.</p>

<p>“Now, the dimensions and rhythmic proportions
on which Solomon, on which Hiram, King
of Tyre, and on which Hiram Abiff builded the
wondrous Temple, were enshrined in the Great
Pyramid just five hundred years before.</p>

<p>“The Temple diagram, conceived under the
starry cope of heaven, is made by drawing on
a diameter of 1,000 inches, a circle, about which
and in which is described a square, again a
circle and a square circumscribed. The areas
of the various squares and circles here drawn,
equal those of the porch of Solomon’s Temple
(125,000 square inches), of the holy place (500,000
square inches) and the Holy of Holies; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
latter of which is encircled in a nest of circles
and squares and the original radius of which, five
hundred inches, was the whole length of the
Holy of Holies itself.</p>

<p>“Now let us retrace our steps through five
centuries and enter the great monument of Chem,
to obey the prophetic mandate of the angel to
the holy St. John, and ‘arise and measure the
temple and its altar.’</p>

<p>“In the king’s chamber the volume of a certain
portion of the room equals fifty times that of
the coffer—the relation of the ark to the brazen
sea in the Temple. Drawing the diagram of
the pyramid to a scale having as the height, the
mean height of the king’s chamber (232.52
inches), the magistral line is 412.13 inches, or
the length of the chambers. The base of the
triangle is the number of days in a year, 365.24
inches, and the radius of that circle having an
area of 365.24 inches squared, is 206.06 inches,
or the width of the chamber. Constructing a
pyramid triangle of height equal to the width
of the chamber, the magistral line of the completed
pyramid is the year number 365.24 inches—the
perimeter of the base, double the two
other important chamber dimensions—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
length, 412.13 inches, and the second height,
235.24 inches. The entire pyramid design comports
with that of the chamber, and those of the
coffer and of the ante-chamber, which is in fact
the ante-chamber to modern civilization.</p>

<p>“Leave the great step at the southern end of
the Grand Gallery—a yard high and a yard
plus a cubit wide—and we find stretching
across the ante-chamber a granite leaf, of two
blocks slid in vertical grooves. On the upper
of these blocks is the only ornament in the pyramid—a
boss, nearly semi-circular in face—exactly
an inch high and an inch in westerly displacement
from the centre of the leaf. The
cubic contents of this inch-high boss are one
pint. Its volume of water weighs just one pound.
The inch, the pint, the pound, so often changed,
so often lost; restored by one method and verified
after such restoration, by the boss on the
leaf which bars the way in the ante-chamber!
The base of the boss is a chord of five inches or
a span; its centre one sacred cubit or five spans
from the hidden end of the leaf. The top
block, apparently irregular in upper outline, is
41.2 inches long, 15.7 wide, and 48.57 in mean
height, giving a contents in cubic inches of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
31,415.9-၊-, which contains the relation between
the diameter and the circumference of a circle.
The lower block has a contents of exactly one-fourth
of the coffer, or an Anglo-Saxon ‘quarter’.
On this leaf, by reference to the boss, we find
also recorded or prophesied the twenty-four
inch gauge and the three-foot rule, as well as
that sacred cubit of twenty-five inches, which
is commensurable with the polar diameter of the
earth.</p>

<p>“The base of the boss is five, the central one
of the nine digits, a number so hated by the
Egyptians, even of the present day, as to be
marked by them with a 0 on their watches—but
the sacred number of the Shepherd Kings, who
embodied it in the five-sided, five-angled, five-proportioned
monument which they came so
far to build, and which was the key to the proportions
and dimensions of that Temple in
which the five books of Moses were sacred to a
people who left the land of their oppressors,
five abreast, ‘with high hands,’ with outspread
fingers, flaunting their number in the faces of
the Egyptians, to whom it brought so much bad
luck.</p>

<p>“From the Pentalpha or five-pointed star may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
be reproduced the pyramid and the Temple proportions
and those of the perfect human body—for
this being inscribed in a circle, the centre of
the star and circle being at the pubis, the arms
and legs spread out easily just reach the points
of the star—the centre of the breast being midway
from the pubis to the crown of the head,
and the base of the knee-cap midway from the
pubis to the sole of the foot. The pyramid
diagram gives the correct proportions of the
human body with equal exactness and detail.”</p>

<p>I felt attracted to this man who drew so
freely from an apparently inexhaustible mental
storehouse, and who so logically connected facts
as to weave from mere numbers so wondrous a
fabric; but I dared not intrude my callow personality
upon one so well-rounded. As we
went down the smooth stone steps, his foot
slipped, and he would have fallen headlong had
I not been fortunate enough to catch and support
him. Even as it was, he wrenched his
foot, so that he gladly accepted my proffered assistance
to his car.</p>

<p>It turned out that he, too, went down town, although
further than I; and we entered the same
surface car. He honored me by a request for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
an exchange of cards; and on the one which he
handed me I read the name “Roger Brathwaite”;
no address being given, although I
learned from him that he resided in one of those
old wards, once fashionable, where still a few
old-fashioned people of means live in commodious
old dwellings, and refuse to be crowded out
by factory and warehouse, be they never so
lofty and noisy by day, never so lonely and
gloomy by night.</p>

<p>Some three weeks later, I met Brathwaite in
the street, and in walking with him, for a few
blocks, learned that he had been a friend of my
grandfather—whose name I bore in full. He
told me that he had been inquiring concerning
me, of my employers, and of others; and that
he had had such good reports that he wished
me to call upon him the next afternoon, at the
address which he now gave, and where, he remarked,
he wished to make a business proposition
which might be to my advantage.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that before the hour appointed,
I bent my steps towards the place of
meeting.</p>

<p>The house was one of those ugly comfortable-looking
four-story and basement brick structures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
with generous doors and wide and abundant
windows, which the wealthy New Yorker
of three generations ago, be he merchant prince
or landed proprietor, built for himself and intended
for his descendants, but which have
been crowded out of notice by towering factories,
storehouses and tenement buildings. Its
wide granite steps and curiously-wrought iron
railings, its great doorway, upheld by pairs of
fluted pillars enclosing narrow lights at each
side of the silver-handled single door, and
capped by a semi-circular transom, whispered of
the quiet dignified early days of the century;
while the puffing of the exhaust steam across
the way, and the snarling and buzzing of the
machinery in the piano factory next door, spoke
of its noisy and commonplace close.</p>

<p>Musk-rose and woodbine formerly luxuriated
in its garden; star-proof elms once threw blue-tinted
moonlight shadows on its now-mellowing
walls; and high-bred dames once trod with
dainty feet its smooth and polished floors. The
glory of the neighborhood, like that of Ichabod,
had departed—but the scrupulous neatness of
the old mansion stood out among the dirt and
squalor of its surroundings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>In response to my ring, the door was opened
by a grave and quiet maid-servant of the olden
school; capped, aproned and slippered, with
gray hairs thickly sprinkling the brown. On
learning my name she directed me to ascend to
the study in the fourth story, where I would
have no difficulty in finding the master of the
house.</p>

<p>As I passed up the wide staircase trod by so
many feet now motionless, I could see through
the open doors, as well as in all the halls,
shelves upon shelves of closely-packed books,
and long tables and racks in great numbers,
laden with what seemed maps and charts of
nothing in particular, or things in general. It
was evident, however, that whatever archives
these were, they were numerous, well arranged,
and of great diversity of age and subject.</p>

<p>The fourth story reached, I found myself in a
great loft-like apartment, covering nearly the
entire floor, and filled, like those below it, with
book-laden cases, and tables thickly strewn with
charts and great portfolios.</p>

<p>My host received me with the grave sweet
courtesy which sat so well upon him, and
begged me to permit him for a few moments to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
put the finishing touches upon a piece of work,
before entering upon the matter concerning
which he had, as he put it, done himself the
honor to ask me to confer with him.</p>

<p>“While I complete my work,” said he, “look
about you. Note well my friends of all ages, in
whose company I have passed many busy years.
They are ‘the abstracts and brief chronicles of
the time.’ Around them, with tendrils strong as
flesh and blood, my pastime and my happiness
have grown. Milton said: ‘A good book is the
precious life-blood of a master spirit embalmed
and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond
life,’ and I have found it so. Browning wrote—and
mark well that a hidden import lies in his
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent6">“‘Books are men of higher stature,</div>
<div class="verse">And the only men who speak aloud for future times to hear.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>I availed myself of the opportunity to look
about me, and as the charts seemed but a meaningless
tangle of long and short lines of black
and the three primary colors, parallel and interlacing,
I betook myself to an inspection of the
book-shelves, each plainly lettered with the
class of its contents. I could see that the works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
here were mainly historical, and arranged in
divisions corresponding to periods and epochs
in the world’s history.</p>

<p>Here for instance in the section of Modern
History, and in that division devoted to the
Formation of Distinct Nationalities were Longman’s
“Lectures on English History,” Michelet’s
“History of France,” Brougham’s “England and
France Under the House of Lancaster,” Edgar’s
“Wars of the Roses,” Kirk’s “Charles the Bold,”
and scores of other histories proper, to say nothing
of Botta’s “Dante,” Campbell’s “Life of Petrarch,”
and similar works throwing light on
men and manners between 1300 and 1490 A. D.
The shelves belonging to “The Age of the Great
Discoveries” were loaded with Major’s “Life
of Prince Henry of Portugal,” Irving’s “Life and
Voyages of Columbus,” and “Voyages and Discoveries
of the Companions of Columbus,” Prescott’s
“Ferdinand and Isabella,” Ranke’s and
D’Aubigné’s histories of the Reformation, Prescott’s
“Conquests of Mexico and Peru,” and all
those other standards which tell of men and
events from 1490 to 1530. The system was
perfect; the manner in which it was carried out,
wonderful.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>I had no time to observe more, for Brathwaite
having completed some careful plotting upon a
chart which covered a long table, rose and led
me to a seat near his desk, where, his earnest
eyes gleaming with a strange sense of power, his
rich voice vibrant with magnetism, he thus addressed
me:—</p>

<p>“The other evening you heard the comments
of our brethren as to the great money value of
a knowledge of the near future; but not one
word was said as to what an incalculable boon
to the human race would be the revelation of
the general condition of men, morals, law, liberty,
and all things great and small, at each
decade yet to come. You may have heard me
remark, almost unconsciously, that such knowledge
of the future was not so impossible as one
might think; and the exclamation may have
impressed you, if at all, with an idea of the
mental irresponsibility of the one who uttered it.
But I think that I can convince you, who are
the first to whom I have addressed myself on
the subject save my dear wife—now gone before
me—that my remark was not only compatible
with the soundest mental powers, but warranted
by a degree of special study and training,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
a duration of special application, far beyond the
usual.</p>

<p>“I was long ago impressed with the idea that
many of those long-past occurrences about
which learned historians disagree, could be
cleared up by the light of induction; that as
like causes have ever produced like effects, any
causes, however remote in time, might be deduced
from their effects, if only the records were
sufficiently full and accurate, and the method
sufficiently philosophical and thorough. It
seemed, for instance, unreasonable that so great
discrepancies should exist as to names and arrangements
of rulers, and commencement and
duration of dynasties, of those very Hykshos, or
Shepherd Kings, of whom I spoke the other
night in those sacred precincts. Manetho (according
to Josephus), states that they reigned
five hundred and eleven years, but cites only
reigns amounting to two hundred and sixty
years; while Africanus makes the duration of
those reigns two hundred and eighty-four years,
and Eusebius one hundred and three. Africanus
makes the Shepherds consist of the fifteenth,
sixteenth and seventeenth dynasties, and
to have ruled nine hundred and fifty-three years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
but gives the names and reigns of only one,
which he calls the fifteenth, while Eusebius
claims it to have been the seventeenth. Bronsen
makes their rule end 1639 B. C.; Lipsius,
1842 B. C.; yet if we place the discovered date
of Thothmes III. (1445 B. C.) in his sixteenth
year, the close of the Hykshos dominion must
have been about 1500 B. C.</p>

<p>“In my early life I set about the task of reconciling
these discrepancies by converging lines
of testimony; and so satisfactory were the results,
so unerringly was each cause deduced
from its many effects, that I conceived the idea
of not only reconciling historical discrepancies
as to occurrences and motives, but reading the
future by continuing each chain of reasoning
into the time to come. In other words, if by
my inductive method, more light is thrown on
the occurrences in Babylon, Media, Lydia,
Egypt, twenty-five centuries ago, than by the
non-inductive method, upon those at Shiloh, but
twenty-five years past, it should be safer to predict
by it the outcomings of the next generation,
than by the usual methods, those of the next
spring or summer. I deemed that ‘by labor and
intent study (which I take to be my portion in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
this life) joined with the strong propensity of
nature, I might perhaps leave something so
written to after times, that they should not willingly
let it die.’ Each year that I continued
my studies, which embraced not only the collection
and assimilation of facts, but their classification
and the formation of deductions therefrom,
the more firmly I become impressed with
the idea of turning the electric light of induction
along the path of prophecy, rather than merely
illuminating therewith the fogs of history.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated</div>
<div class="verse">To closeness, and the bettering of my mind,’</div>
</div></div>

<p>set about this problem. Ample means, an excellent
constitution, and correct and regular
habits, have enabled me to accomplish during
the past fifty years—for through so long a
time have I been striving for my object—much
more than is given to most men to do, and more
even than I had given myself reason to expect
or hope. We now stand in ‘this narrow isthmus
’twixt two boundless seas, the past, the future,
two eternities.’ <span class="smcap">I have explored them both</span>.</p>

<p>“But I detect in your manner an impatience
which I cannot condemn, and shall plunge at
once into an explanation of my methods, leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
until later a statement of what I have been
able to accomplish thereby.</p>

<p>“It has long been the custom of professional
engineers to represent graphically on sheets of
paper ruled in squares, various properties of
matter under regularly-varying conditions. For
instance, to show the electric conductivity of
wire at various temperatures, horizontal strips
represent degrees of temperature, and vertical
strips, degrees of conductivity; and if a line
connecting points corresponding to conductivity
at various temperatures be convexly curved
above, it shows that conductivity decreases
more rapidly than temperature increases. If
the line be straight, it shows that conductivity
decreases in the same ratio as temperature increases.
The use of several colored lines, or of
solid and of variously broken or dotted lines,
permits comparison of the conductivity of several
metals or alloys.</p>

<p>“This, as a method of recording and comparing
experiments, is quite convenient; but it is
even more useful. The location of from three
to ten points permits the experimenter to deduce
accurately what would have been the results of
other accurately-performed experiments under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
similar conditions. Whether the line is a
straight one, or an hyperbola, or one expressed
by some algebraical equation, the mean can be
known from the extremes or one of the extremes
deduced from the other extreme and the mean.
In other words, <i>in this principle lies the key to
prophecy</i>. For, given a mode of expressing
social conditions, legal enactments, human emotions,
extending through a sufficient period, and
known with sufficient accuracy to be properly
charted, <i>the present may be made to throw
light upon a past too dim, and past and present
point with unerring finger to the future, be it near
or distant</i>.</p>

<p>“When Byron wrote ‘The best of prophets of
the future is the past,’ he ‘builded better than he
knew.’</p>

<p>“But that the scientific seer may surely venture
on the task of piercing the fogs which screen
the past from our curious eyes, or of lifting the
veils which hide the future from our anxious
gaze, the simple squares and lines of the engineer
must be so developed and supplemented as
to represent more than two sets of conditions at
once. They must show simultaneously several
influences which are silently making history.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
It is to the enlarged application of the principle
of graphical representation, that the last
ten years of a life, formerly spent in the accumulation
and classification of recorded knowledge,
have been devoted. How well I have succeeded,
I shall shortly show you. But first I
must tell you by what means I have triumphed
over oblivion and set upon myself the crown of
prophecy.</p>

<p>“In these charts and relief maps, horizontal
distance represents time; vertical distance,
space, or sections of country. Red, yellow, blue
and black lines permit recording four social or
other conditions at once, while elevation and
degree of roughness of surface add two more to
the number simultaneously expressible.</p>

<p>“As a simple instance, this chart is devoted
to the Sacredness of the Marriage Relation,
from the year one of the Christian era to the
present day. The portions to the left indicate
early periods, those in the centre, present time;
those at the right, time to come; each decade
being represented by one-half inch of length of
the chart. The various strips are devoted to
different geographical divisions; that given to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
our own country being sub-divided into strips
corresponding to its various States and Territories.
The depth of red tint shows the degree
of respect or disrespect for woman; blue
tints correspond to enactments rendering marriage
more sacred, divorce more difficult, the
rights of women more general and acknowledged.
Thus we see in this blood-red quarter
to the left, an indication of promiscuity in the
sexual relation. The lighter red stands for
polyandry, or that state in which the woman
has several husbands, living peacefully together.
This is due to a scarcity of women, owing to the
female infants being exposed at birth or sold as
slaves.</p>

<p>“Note that in Great Britain, in the time of
Julius Caesar, this form prevailed; and that
it continues up to the present day in the Neilgherry
Hills, India, and with the Herero tribe
of South Africa. It appears in greatest perfection
in some tribes of Thibet, where all
the brothers of a family have but one wife in
common.</p>

<p>“Here among the Eskimos, Aleutians, and
Kolushes of the north and northwest coasts
of America, we have still a marked red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
stripe, due to the fact that among these tribes
a married woman is the wife of all the married
men of the tribe, and each married man is the
husband of all the married women—which does
not, however, prevent the distinctions between
the married and unmarried being rigidly observed.</p>

<p>“This state is followed by polygamy, indicated
by a lighter shade of red, and which accounts
for this local patch in the Utah strip, nearly
down to 1890.</p>

<p>“Monogamy is rare among the ruder races, but
this strip of paler red in Ceylon is to represent
the Veddahs, where each male takes but one
wife, and is true to her alone until separated
by death.</p>

<p>“Almost simultaneously with the fading in
the red tint, which fading represents increasing
respect for women, we have a deepening of the
blue tint lines which stand for ecclesiastical
and legal protection of the marriage relation
and of the rights of woman. Thus we see the
chart changing from deep red to reddish purple,
from this through purple to bluish purple; and
the future shows deep blue as indicating the
absolute recognition, formal and social, of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
woman’s claims to honor, protection, and property.
See now, from the year 400 A. D. on to
the right, a sudden deepening of the blue, indicating
the canonical law pronouncing a marriage
indissoluble—as is still the law in the
Roman Catholic Church.</p>

<p>“Note here local differences of color due to the
fact that among the Shawnee Indians the
women, while the only drudges, yet own all
the property; and that among the Osages of our
Western plains the oldest daughter on her marriage
comes into possession of all the family
property.</p>

<p>“In our own country, see the extra blueness of
South Carolina, which has no divorce laws; of
Georgia, in which absolute divorce is granted
only after the concurrent verdict of two juries,
at different terms of the court; and of New
York, where it is accorded for but one cause
only—adultery. See how the blue is paled in
the District of Columbia and in Wisconsin,
where the granting of divorce for any cause is
practically left to the discretion of the Court.
See how feeble the blue in Illinois and in Rhode
Island, yet note how it is overwhelmed by the
other strips, so that it is safe to predict that by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
1925 those States will have been compelled by
pressure of public opinion to enact and enforce
laws more thoroughly protecting women. This
we must read in connection with the chart
showing centralization of government and uniformity
of legislation in America, and with that
one showing the increase of Roman Catholicism
in the State of Illinois, and in its neighbor
Missouri.</p>

<p>“In the same way I here show graphically the
evolution of recorded speech, from thought-writing
by pictures—as practised among the
American tribes, particularly those of Mexico
and Central America, in China and the valley
of the Nile—to sound-writing as first done by
rebuses, and the cuneiform method of syllabic
writing in the Valley of Mesopotamia; then
alphabets proper, first non-phonetic as adopted
by the Hebrews, Greeks and Romans, and by
ourselves; then phonetic, which the rapidly increasing
rate of increase of the yellow lines representing
the phonetic principle shows will
soon become universal.</p>

<p>“This method—scientific, accurate and complete,
in conception and execution—has enabled
me to foretell accurately the condition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
men, manners and matter on this earth fifty, a
hundred or a thousand years from now.</p>

<p>“‘By this time, like one who had set out on
his way by night, and travelled through a region
of smooth and idle dreams, our history now arrives
on the confines, where daylight and truth
meet us with a clear dawn, representing to our
view, though at far distance, true colors and
shapes.’</p>

<p>“Although I am strong and lusty for my years,
the span of my life is drawing to a close, and I
have so far been able only to record as a test
prophecy, the conditions which will prevail half
a century from now.</p>

<p>“With a portion of this history, impartially
written in advance of the events therein recorded,
I now entrust you, that you may the
better enter into the spirit of my life-work.
The roll which I here hand you, contains a
fragment of history which will be true when
you have attained my age of three score years
and ten.</p>

<p>“I am desirous of a helper who shall not
only aid me during my lifetime, to record events,
but carry on the wonderful work, when these
eyes shall long have been sightless, these hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
but useless dust. Should the concise prophetic
record which I here give you attract your interested
attention, and the bold and original
method by which it is attained win your confidence,
I should be glad to have you become at
once my assistant, and eventually my successor.</p>

<p>“The key to the method I have long ago reduced
to writing, so that in case of my death, before
imparting all the details to any one, the
science and the art of scientific prophecy shall
not die with me, but shall live forever, like my
own immortal soul.”</p>

<p>Taking the manuscript, with an eagerness
which I could scarce conceal, I expressed my
appreciation of his confidence and good will,
no less than my admiration of the wonderful
method by which mere dots and lines, veriest
material and mechanical exponents, should reveal
the secrets of things past and to come.</p>

<p>The venerable professor bowed me courteously
from his presence, and quitting the old
mansion, depository of so much knowledge, of
so many hopes, I was soon within earshot of the
rattle and roar of the great city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>the glittering starlight beamed—but I heeded
it not. A few minutes’ brisk walking brought
me to my own door, my hand clutching, through
the thin cloth of my light overcoat, the precious
roll which contained that record, more precious
than the chronicles of kings long since vanished
into thin air; for was it not the unrolling of the
time to come—my future, Estelle’s, and our
children’s? What glass cases filled with registers
of dynasties of the long ago; what sarcophagi,
enclosing the mortal remains of monarchy
and sages who swayed the earth’s destinies
when time was yet young; what crumbling
rolls, or incised cylinders, bearing enactments
which shook nations to their foundations,
achievements which reduced whole peoples to
abject slavery, so interesting as these soft,
closely-written pages, on which I—I alone now
of all mortals on earth—was privileged to hear
the happenings of the time to come? What
treasury, with walls bursting under pressure of
silver bars and golden ingots, with cabinets enclosing
priceless jewels—so valuable as those
squares of paper, from which those records were
compiled, yet which a vagrant spark could reduce
to nothingness?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>I sprang up the stairs, three at a time, with
my brain on fire, my eyes wide open, glistening;
the blood throbbing in temples and tingling in
finger tips. Like Monte Cristo, I felt that the
world was mine.</p>

<p>So eager was I to know with what the womb
of the future was pregnant, that I disregarded,
in favor of my excited mind, the claims of my
wearied body; and forgetful of the fact that I
had eaten nothing since morn, I pondered far
into the night over the revelations of the wonderful
manuscript entrusted to me by my wonderful
new-found friend.</p>

<p>Omitting some introductory portions which
consisted of practically the same partial explanations
as to methods, which Brathwaite had
given me orally, I give this manuscript entire.</p>

</div></div>


<p>With my feet planted on the one thousand
eight hundred and ninety-third step in that
part of time’s imperishable edifice which has
risen since the birth of Jesus, the Blessed Nazarene,
and my head above the clouds of five decades
which hover above it, I, Roger Brathwaite,
read as upon a printed scroll the yet-unwritten
records of the year 1943. These I have
reduced to writing as an earnest of what may
come when my system of verifying and completing
history and of anticipating the future
shall have been carried out as fully for five hundred
years as for fifty years to come.</p>

<p>I see around me the millions of this year 1943<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
as people of the time in which I live—or rather
find myself so transported mentally that the
events of fifty years from 1893 onwards are as
of the past. I see the households and the nations
of 1943, and with them hold plain converse
in the universal tongue of the Electric Age; for
the language written, and to a great extent
spoken all over the civilized world, is everywhere
the same; having been prepared by a
committee of philologists of all countries, and
formally adopted at a congress held in Paris
in 1915. It combines the soft liquid beauty
of the Italian, the dignity of the Spanish, and
the majesty of the Greek; the adaptability to
new ideas of the German, the delicate shadings
of the French, and the business-like exactness
of the English. Its spelling is phonetic; and
phonetic printing is as common as phonographic
writing.</p>

<p>The written language has been greatly enriched
by characters to represent signs which in
the year 1900 could not be expressed in writing
or in printing; as, for instance, whistling,
clucking and kissing, barking, howling, groaning,
laughter, etc. In fact, every sound which
can be imitated by the human voice may be so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
recorded upon paper that it can be read and reproduced
by any one (not dumb) who can read
and write.</p>

<p>The theatre is the great preservative of the
purity of spoken language, both in grammar
and in pronunciation; each great actor being an
<i>arbiter elegantiarum</i> in matters of speech. Censors
hold all public speakers to a high standard
of pronunciation and diction; and the study
of grammar, while pursued by the more highly
educated, has been largely done away with by
reason of purity of speech being attained by
force of example and criticism.</p>

<p>The use of the typewriting machine is universal,
the machines printing phonetic characters
exactly the same as those used in book and
newspaper work, with variable spacing, and justifying
perfectly. These machines are so arranged
that they may be connected with the
telegraphic system; so that a letter may be
written in New York or in Paris by a person
in Chicago and Melbourne; and all books of
record are written in by machine only.</p>

<p>Writing is phonographic or phonetic, only;
each word being composed of as many characters
as there are sounds therein; no two sounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
having the same character, and each sound
having but one letter.</p>

<p>Printing has become one of the most noble
of the fine arts. Photographs in half tones are
printed by every daily, and printing in natural
colors (for many years a common feature of the
book trade), is beginning to be adopted by the
more enterprising. The boundaries between
lithographic and relief printing have been largely
broken down by zincographic and other processes;
the speed of impression more than
quadrupled, while the sharpness of fine lines
and the blackness of masses are as perfect as
formerly in etching and line engraving. In
these latter branches great progress has been
made, both in speed of production of the plate
and in the rapidity of printing therefrom.</p>

<p>There is wonderful advancement in telegraphing,
pictures and fac-simile documents being
sent over the wires, when wires are required;
although in most cases wires are not needed;
and what few there are, lie hidden from public
view. There are, indeed, some inventors so
expert that they can telegraph pictures in natural
colors, taking advantage of the great improvements
in photography, by which any object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
can, at one exposure, be photographed permanently
in its proper colors.</p>

<p>By the new system of telegraphic printing,
news is set up in several cities simultaneously,
in column width, all ready to be worked off
on the great hourly papers, which with their
beautiful colored illustrations, are a marvel as
well as a convenience.</p>

<p>A newly-discovered process transmits from
the scene of any great event, as a conflagration,
convention, or battle, an accurate photograph
in colors, which is reproduced in one or a hundred
cities, there to be printed in the local
journals, which latter have become, in fact,
hourly bulletins of the on-goings of the neighborhood
and of the world at large.</p>

<p>Telegraphic and telephonic communication
with moving railway trains has been for forty
years an accomplished fact, so that the business
man, desiring to keep up his correspondence
from and with his office, while travelling, can
readily do so; and may, in fact, from time to
time, talk with those at home; while a statesman
may from his seat in a pneumatic or electric
railway car, address his fellow-legislators in session
assembled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Vessels at sea may be communicated with by
both telegraph and telephone, no wire being employed.
Soundings are automatically indicated
and recorded as the vessel moves along, so that
the log not only is made up as the voyage progresses,
but serves as a chart to guide the course.</p>

<p>In the homes of the masses as well as in those
of the millionaires, there is little of comfort or
convenience to be desired. The luxuries of
1893 are the necessities of 1943; while to these
have been added refinements undreamed of fifty
years before.</p>

<p>Houses made of concrete in one piece, without
joint, defy wind, storm and the intrusion of
“rats and mice and such small deer.”</p>

<p>In every house, there is a system of piping
and wiring by which heating-gas, lighting-gas
and oxygen; hot and cold, salt and fresh water,
steam and electric lighting and telephone service
are laid on; while thorough ventilation is
effected by a system of exhaust operated from a
central station. The sanitary appliances are
under control of the municipal authorities; and
disinfecting solutions are as necessary a part
thereof, as the supply of fresh or salt water
which flushes out the waste-pipes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>The law, which is the conservator of health as
well as of morals and of peace, compels every
house to have bathtubs in proportion to the
number of people living therein; and bathing is
practically made compulsory. Public baths in
which, as in the days of the ancient Romans,
men meet for social converse and the transaction
of business, are maintained in every town
of any importance; medicated and electrified
plunges and showers being under the management
of experts in hydropathic sanitation.</p>

<p>In the houses of the wealthy, and in the clubs,
the opera is “wired on,” just as hot and cold
water, warm and cold air, electricity, and other
conveniences are in the same way “laid on.” In
fact, the celebrated preachers are heard by
those who prefer to stay at home; every one
may sit in his or her chair and get the utterances
of the most distinguished orators as well as of
the most celebrated singers and musicians.</p>

<p>As noted under another head, law-givers and
public officials listen to and address their confrères,
their colleagues and their constituents,
at all times and in all places; from their homes,
from public baths and from public conveyances;
so that the Senator from Oregon may address at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the same moment both Houses in the Capitol at
Washington, while preparing in the intervals of
his private business and local political matters,
to make a campaign speech in the Mississippi
Valley, without leaving the shores of the Pacific.</p>

<p>All new houses are monolithic and must be
built from plans approved by the General Council
of Architects. The law requires, under
heavy penalties, that every building shall have
a liberal and specified window-area, and be
properly warmed and ventilated.</p>

<p>The new system of diffused daylight is by most
preferred to electricity. The panels with which
the walls and ceilings are covered, have a power
of absorbing sunlight all day and giving it out
at night, thus making the rooms pleasantly
bright by night. All beds are enclosed in beautiful
cabinets (connected with the general system
of ventilation), so that one steps from a
bright chamber into his comfortable sleeping-compartment,
and there, lulled by sweet music,
if he so wish it, sleeps the sleep of the happy
dweller of 1943.</p>

<p>The compartments are warmed, as the occupants
prefer, by warm air from the general supply,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
by electricity from the common central station,
or by heating-gas manufactured at a
distance from the city, and pumped through
long miles of pipes to where it is needed.</p>

<p>The streets are lighted with a soft, well-diffused
illumination, bright enough to enable
reading from ordinary print, at any point. The
electric wires which carry currents to supply
the lamps, are invisible. Each house contributes
its quota to the illumination, by electric
glow-lamps over its doors and windows, so that
the effect, upon a moonless night, is fairy-like.</p>

<p>The sea-board cities have salt water “laid on”
for bathing purposes, street-washing and use at
fires; although the methods of fire extinguishment
have greatly changed for the better. Few
fires are possible, and those are generally put
out by chemical vapors, automatically discharged
from pipes placed in every room and
passage.</p>

<p>The results of paternal oversight as carried
out by republican institutions, are most gratifying;
the annual death-rate being reduced to
about 7 per thousand in sections favored by Nature,
and never exceeding 10, in the most crowded
districts and those least blessed in climate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Medical science and art no longer work blindly;
no longer act hap-hazard.</p>

<p>The average life of man (largely, let it be said,
due to the efforts of the life insurance companies
in enforcing sanitary improvements and in fostering
medical and surgical research), has been
about doubled. Surgical operations which
fifty years before were deemed chimerical or
impossible are now, thanks to the improved anaesthetics
and antiseptics at command, performed
most frequently; so that laparotomy,
the Caesarian operation, bone-grafting, removal
of diseased portions of the brain and extirpation
of the kidneys, and their replacement by those
of the sheep or calf, are common and successful.</p>

<p>Acute disease is treated almost exclusively by
heat, cold and electricity. The subcutaneous
injections discovered, or rather foreshadowed, by
Brown-Sequard, have been brought to such pitch
of perfection that by their use the vigor of forty
is maintained until eighty or even ninety years.
The noble work of Koch in subjugating pulmonary
consumption has rendered that dread
disease no longer contagious, while brighter light
upon the mode of living, and improvements in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
comfort at home and when travelling, have
made safe for consumptives many climates in
which formerly no one with predisposition to
lung trouble could live. The sanitary precautions
enforced by local and National bodies have
completely stopped and prevented the ravages of
typhoid and other filth diseases; while the terrible
effects of such epidemics as the grippe are
made impossible in the face of the medical
knowledge of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Transfusion of blood is accomplished, in case
of wounds by accident, without inconvenience
to the one supplying the life-fluid, or danger to
the recipient, while effective tonics bring about
the rapid replacement of the amount of blood
abstracted in the emergency.</p>

<p>The triumphs of electricians in their wonderful
science have caused the twentieth century
to be named the Age of Electricity.</p>

<p>The power of great rivers, such as Niagara, is
utilized by being converted into electricity and
transmitted where desired; also stored up at
convenient distributing places, to be used when
wanted. Wave force has been taken hold of
and similarly carried to great distances and used
in quantities, or at times, to suit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>The wind and the lightning are in the same
way harnessed to do man’s bidding; so that
each storm contributes to public wealth to an
extent greater than the damage it works.</p>

<p>Lightning is no longer a source of danger. The
electric and other connections of the building
render an injurious shock impossible; and where
it does strike any building in the protected circuit,
the charge is stored to be used for domestic
purposes, such as driving the passenger and
goods elevators in the house, or furnishing light
and heat.</p>

<p>Welding is accomplished by electricity, on a
large scale. Not only are ordinary masses of
steel so made one, but the hulls, masts and yards
of steel vessels are thus welded together electrically,
so that there is no possibility of a seam
“giving,” nor of a leak taking place. Steel
bridge-members being similarly electrically
welded together, the danger from such bridges
giving way is reduced to an insignificant minimum.</p>

<p>Primary batteries generate an electric current
by chemical action upon coal, without the production
of heat or odor; so that the steam engine
is seldom needed, and, indeed, in many places as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
rarely seen as the wind-mill was in 1893.</p>

<p>Horology, as of old, is one of the exact sciences;
but we find upon every street, electrically-driven
clocks telling to the tenth of a second
the time of day or night; the twenty-four hour
system having come into general use about 1900,
and London time being kept in every city in the
civilized world.</p>

<p>The central stations of the telephone and other
conveniences are worked by the subscribers
themselves; the apparatus in each house enabling
the subscriber to ascertain whether or
not the person with whom he wishes to communicate
is at liberty; and to connect with him
if he is.</p>

<p>All cities on the Continent are connected in a
universal telegraphic and telephonic exchange,
so that San Francisco can write, print or talk in
New Orleans or Montreal. The telephone is so
improved that it can be worked across the Atlantic,
although the Pacific as yet defies all attempts
of inventors to produce a system that
will work without fail under all conditions. By
this wonderful improvement Patti, from her
castle at Craig-y-Nos; Campanini, from his beloved
Italy, and other celebrated artists, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
have delighted those who heard them in New
York, by taking part in a concert together; but
those great artists are but memories, and have
been supplanted by others, with voices improved
by surgery and special nurture until
their range, delicacy and power have been
brought to a degree of perfection of which the
nineteenth century never dreamed.</p>

<p>The chemists have not been far behind the
electricians in their triumphs and successes.</p>

<p>The subject of special plant foods has been,
during the past forty years, taken up by agricultural
chemists with such results that not
only can any special plant be given its special
food, but special portions of it can be developed
in disproportion to the rest; thus, oranges and
lemons can be grown without seeds, and dwarf
wheat practically without any straw. New varieties
of food-plants have been developed from
wild plants, while fertilizers are employed to
dissolve the rocks that are in the soil and render
them at once absorbable by the plant roots.</p>

<p>In metallurgy, surprising progress has been
made. Several new noble metals have been
discovered in the Ural Mountains and in Africa,
giving scientists and jewellers a variety in color,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
hardness and weight, as surprising as pleasing.
The manufacture of steel direct from the ore has
become <i>un fait accompli</i>. Iron is used for
few purposes, steel being cheaper and better.
Aluminum, which is plentifully extracted from
common clay, has taken the place of steel and
bronze for many uses, in fact for all places
where great mass is not practically a requisite.</p>

<p>The chemist is even more ingenious and more
of a benefactor than his predecessor of the nineteenth
century. He has produced from coal oil,
in paying quantities, both sugar and vinegar;
and has also solved the problem of making
sugar from starch.</p>

<p>The majority of fabrics are rendered, by
chemical processes, proof against fire and mildew;
and the law renders the use of such fireproof
substances compulsory where wood, cloth
or paper is used in building construction.</p>

<p>Medical and chemical science has so far advanced
that special foods are devised for particular
parts of the body. The man who uses
his brain employs certain condiments; he who
gains his living by the sweat of his brow others,
and so on.</p>

<p>Foods are concentrated to a degree once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
deemed absolutely impossible. A vessel can
carry in a small chest, which two men can lift,
a week’s supply of nourishment for five hundred
people.</p>

<p>Antiseptics of pleasant taste and non-poisonous
character permit the preservation to almost
illimitable extent, of heretofore perishable
foods.</p>

<p>The profusion of new dyes is so great that industrial
chemists have, by common consent, restricted
the output of shades to enable buyers
and manufacturers to keep up with the pace.
The shades for each year are announced in
advance two to five years ahead. Among these
dyes are many which have a sheen truly metallic,
thus producing effects never before
dreamed of outside of Nature’s laboratory. The
butterfly and the peacock are out-rivaled; the
gorgeous beauties with which Brazil abounded
before her more complete settlement and civilization,
cast into the shade. Truly “Solomon, in
all his glory, was not arrayed like unto one of
these” might the on-looker say on beholding a
bevy of young girls, clad in the latest spring
fashions.</p>

<p>There have been produced numberless new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
alkaloids having-medicinal effects of character
as various as the sources and methods of production
of the drugs themselves.</p>

<p>The four haloids, iodine, bromine, chlorine and
fluorine, have long been discovered to be allotropic
forms of one and the same simple element;
and the relations between carbon and
boron, and carbon and silicon, have been traced
to such a degree as to render possible the production
of new steels and other alloys, comprising
a range of properties undreamed of in
1893.</p>

<p>Diamonds are no longer precious stones, since
they are electrically deposited in great quantities
at trifling expense; as are, of course, all
other stones once styled precious.</p>

<p>The dead are disposed of by cremation in gas
furnaces, or by dessication; and the establishments
for performing these operations, and for
disposing of the remains, are under strictest governmental
supervision.</p>

<p>The use of explosives—confined to peaceful
operations since war has been voted too expensive—has
largely increased; and there are numbers
of them which, while explosible only by
electricity applied in a particular way—thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
preventing possibility of accident—have a force
which throws into the shade all the dynamite
and other explosives of the preceding century.</p>

<p>The clothing worn by men is very little
changed from that of the century previous, except
in texture and materials. Numberless
plants of Mexican and African origin have been
brought into use as bearing textile fibres; and
improvements in spinning and weaving have enabled
the production of fabrics of most surprising
fineness and strength. The silk hat, which
was the pest of civilized men in the previous
century, has given place to a modification of
what was once known as the Alpine, save that
the new head-covering is lighter and more
graceful, and those employed in winter are
warmer than the others. In summer, straw has
been superseded by paper. The women have
decided upon a dress in external appearance not
dissimilar to that which for so many centuries
made Japanese women so picturesque. Corsets
have been abolished, and pictures bearing date
of the preceding century, in which the bustle
is a prominent feature, have been tabooed as
suggestive if not indecent.</p>

<p>The manufacture of paper has so greatly been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
improved, that sheets are now used of only
one-half the thickness formerly rendered necessary
for any purpose; and of finish as marvellous
as their strength. Leather possesses a
suppleness, a resistance to wear, and a beauty
and variety of grain, as surprising as desirable,
while it is not only waterproof, but permeable
by the perspiration of the foot.</p>

<p>Iron and steel may be cast into the thinnest
sections and the most complicated forms.</p>

<p>Flour-making is accomplished by air blasts to
perform the disintegration of the wheat grains,
with electrical separation of the various useful
by and waste products. But the new-process
bread is made directly from the decorticated
wheat berry, without ever grinding it into flour;
the baker taking the wheat and doughing it up
directly without ferment.</p>

<p>Timber is dyed of any desired color before felling,
and bent into any shape by steaming, so that
the most complex outlines may be given it without
weakening it.</p>

<p>Umbrella covers and other textile objects of
irregular shape, formerly made up of gored sections,
are now woven in one piece and of any desired
fineness. Rugs and seamless carpets an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
inch thick and of infinite variety in pattern are
produced with any wished-for outline, to fit the
projections and recesses of the apartment for
which they may be ordered.</p>

<p>Flexible and malleable glass are no longer scientific
curiosities; and toughened glass bells
break the night’s silence with their sweet chiming
of the hours as they fly.</p>

<p>In porcelain and other ceramic wares the long-lost
arts of the ancients have been rivalled or
revived; and the most exquisite productions of
the Land of the Rising Sun duplicated or excelled.</p>

<p>In brewing and wine-making all hurtful compounds
are eliminated, and none but the health-giving
and gladdening retained.</p>

<p>In mechanics an entirely new principle has
been applied; the cold of winter, as well as the
heat of summer, being harnessed to do man’s
work. The scientific engineers of 1925 recognized
the fact that in any motor it was the difference
between the initial and final temperatures
of the steam, gas, or other medium
employed, that did the work; this work being
the utilizable percentage of that difference in
temperature; and acting upon this idea, by 1935<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
there were engines which ran by cold as well as
those driven by heat. The snow-fields of winter
then, as well as the great arid plains of summer,
have for some time been used to make and store
up power, which is used only as wanted.</p>

<p>A striking landscape feature is the great
number of windmills, stately, picturesque and
beautiful, which lazily flap their sails or merrily
spin with the brisk breeze, generating and storing
up power for the houses upon which they are
perched. These mills are let run full speed in
the fiercest storms; the surplus of power going
to the owner’s storage system, to be used when
wanted, or contributed to the common stock in
case of need.</p>

<p>Railway cars are made very largely of aluminum
and paper, thus possessing great stiffness,
lightness and strength.</p>

<p>Many new varieties of steel have made their
appearance; boron and silicon being used indifferently
with carbon in forming combinations
with iron, which possesses properties never before
seen in steels of any kind.</p>

<p>The hardening of copper has been rediscovered,
and for twenty-five or more years this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
metal has been tempered and worked just as steel
was in the century preceding.</p>

<p>The manufacture of anti-friction metals has
been so far advanced that the use of lubricants
is rendered unnecessary.</p>

<p>Transportation of the person and of goods,
large and small, is as greatly advanced as that
of ideas and images.</p>

<p>Steam is a crudity of the past century. Pneumatic
and electric railways carry people and
freight with swiftness and safety, in all directions
and at trifling rates. To every house and
from every store, of any importance, pneumatic
tubes radiate from central stations, so that packages
and messages can be sent from any dwelling
or establishment in the system to any other
by simply having connection made through the
central office, as in the old-fashioned way of
telephoning.</p>

<p>Great air-ships hover over city and country,
and a weekly line of dirigible balloons, under
the auspices of the General Government, is in
preparation.</p>

<p>Ocean navigation is rendered both safe and
swift. Great floating palaces ply daily between
Montauk Point and Bristol, making the Atlantic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
transit in three days. Seasickness has been
banished by medical science, and indeed the motion
of the great electrically-driven argosies is so
smooth that there would be little danger of sickness
even without the remedies. Storms are allayed
by the use of oil discharged from these
vessels, which now ride the waves in defiance of
their strength.</p>

<p>New models of vessels, taken from the marine
division of the animal kingdom, have been introduced,
and the rivalry between “deep-keel”
and “centreboard” vessels, which in the latter
quarter of the nineteenth century caused such
absorbing discussion, is as nothing to the interest
manifested by the advocates of the various
models—the “pike,” the “swordfish,” and so on.</p>

<p>Across all great isthmuses there are canals and
ship railways; and projects are under way for a
transcontinental ship railway from New York
to San Francisco.</p>

<p>The bottoms of all great rivers are paved
smoothly and kept clean, so that navigation is
never interfered with by bars; and these rivers
are sources of health and strength rather than
of danger to the cities through or by which they
flow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>In every great city there are upon all but the
minor streets steel plate-ways carrying electric
currents, and upon which the ordinary vehicles
run without noise or jolting; although the excellent
condition of the pavements would seem
to render this unnecessary.</p>

<p>The street paving is monolithic (that is, all in
one piece), of an artificial stone as hard as good
limestone; giving a surface sufficiently gritty to
ensure good hold for the feet of the few horses
which are employed, and yet leaving the surface
smooth, in order that it may be kept clean and
give good traction for the short space of time in
which vehicles (which ordinarily take the tracks
on the plate-ways) are running over it.</p>

<p>In New York City, Arcade railways, with various
ramifications, extend along the main arteries
of travel, and give rapid transit to citizens
and visitors alike. Double tracks in each direction
insure absolute safety, while the express
trains, stopping only at principal stations, have
their separate way; the local trains, stopping at
every block, taking the outer one of each pair
of tracks. The motive power here employed
is electricity, partly brought on from Niagara
and other power-producing stations, and partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
carried along the Jersey and Long Island
coasts, where the waves are busy night and day,
doing the work of New York and other cities.</p>

<p>The vehicles upon the street are driven by
electric power, and the same current which
drives them affords light at night to occupant
and passer-by.</p>

<p>The plate-ways carry an electric current
which may be taken off by those vehicles provided
with necessary motors and connecting
appliances; so that the horses have little traction
to do; and in fact some private vehicles,
never going off the streets supplied with plate-ways,
have no horses at all.</p>

<p>Other private vehicles are supplied with motors
deriving their current from overhead wires,
not through trollies as once done in electric
railways, but by induction.</p>

<p>Storage batteries that are light and compact
have been invented and are already in use for
driving carriages along roads which have
neither plate-ways nor overhead conductors by
which the current can be carried by induction
to the motors within the vehicles. The motors
for such private carriages are no larger than
a man’s hat, and are turned out by the thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
just as Waterbury watches were made in 1893.</p>

<p>In other divisions of the broad domain of science,
than those referred to in detail, the past
fifty years have been laurel-crowned.</p>

<p>Astronomers have not been idle during the
last sixty years or so. They have reached out
into space, and discovered enough asteroids to
account for the lost planet between Mars and
Jupiter; and have supplied the missing link between
Mercury and the sun. With the spectroscope
they have found in the sun and various
planets, several new metals, for which, by analogy
they have searched on earth, and many
of which they have found.</p>

<p>The geologists, delving into the crust of the
earth, have mapped out its entire surface, so
that the location of every considerable quantity
of gold, silver, iron, copper, tin, coal, oil, etc.,
is known and recorded, and useless prospecting
done away with. The Arctic and Antarctic
zones have been thoroughly worked, the open
Polar Sea discovered and regularly traversed,
and the mines of the Polar regions worked regularly
and with profit for metals and minerals
used every day in the world’s industrial pursuits.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Scarcity of rain in any one place is promptly
counteracted by each local government by consent
of the others concerned; great fires being
started to attract the clouds, which will bring in
their arms the friendly drops.</p>

<p>The fine arts of 1943 have kept pace with
other branches of culture.</p>

<p>Sculpture and painting, instead of having
been thrown into the shade by the wonderful
achievements in photography and engraving,
have received a great impetus. Leading citizens
vie with each other in purchasing (sometimes
even in making) statues to adorn their
own homes and gardens, and public streets and
parks. In the same way painting is taught as
a science as well as an art; to be a fair painter
being more common than to be a fair performer
upon the instrument once known as “pianoforte.”
The pipe organ has become the national
musical instrument, and its glorious tones
are heard from houses of far less than palatial
pretensions.</p>

<p>The public buildings of this country, no longer
laughing-stocks for foreigners, are at once spacious,
beautiful, substantial and convenient. In
them the new American style of architecture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
in which proportions are of more value than
arrangement, finds fitting types on every hand.</p>

<p>In every town of any magnitude or importance,
are free museums of science and art, visits
to which are as common as to the beautiful
parks laid out as breathing places in the larger
cities.</p>

<p>Color-masters vie with each other in great
kaleidoscopic exhibitions, which out-rival in
beauty of rapid combinations and successions of
color, the most brilliant pyrotechnic displays of
the generations past.</p>

<p>The art of perfumery has been carried to a
point never even dreamed of by those of the
preceding century. The law steps in and prevents
any one from using, or permitting the
use of, any odor (like musk) which is prejudicial
to health or general comfort. The gamut of
odor has been discovered, and harmonies of perfumes
are made just like those of colors, or of
musical tones. Concerts are given at which,
the great perfume-masters of the day produce
chords and pleasing successions of odors, which
draw great crowds of the most refined, fully appreciative
of the delights there offered.</p>

<p>Flower-culture is a national pastime. Where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
there are no large gardens, small patches are
devoted to floriculture; and in the most crowded
city, window-boxes hold the latest new hybrid
plants and make the most frequented thoroughfares
a garden of beauty. Dwarfing and aggrandizing
plants, by electric currents passed
around their roots, has been practiced for twenty
years upon a large scale; so that in the great
conservatories, one may find tiny plants grown
from the cones of the Yosemite great trees, and
may also see what have sprung from tiny fungi
but are now as large as the old-fashioned cabbages
of the days of President Harrison. The
dyeing of plants and of their flowers by substances
introduced in solution at their roots, is
a fine art most successful and pleasing in its
application.</p>

<p>Banking is much more simple and much more
safe, both for the banker and for the dealer,
than in the old risky days. Panics are impossible.
The wise action of the Bank of England,
in connection with other monetary institutions,
in averting a financial crash in November, 1890,
by coming to the rescue of Baring Brothers with
$55,000,000, began most auspiciously an eminently
successful era of mutual help. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
bank is guaranteed by Government, and the
notes of any bank in any one Government are
good in any country on the globe; the various
Governments having treaties to the effect that
each shall guarantee to the common banking
fund a certain percentage of its revenues, and
the amount of money issued in each country
being in proportion to the net revenue of the
year preceding.</p>

<p>All currency is decimal, and uniform over the
whole civilized globe, greatly facilitating travel
and commerce.</p>

<p>By an ingenious system the great clearing-houses
of each country are united in a National
Clearing-house which serves weekly for all
those in each city the same purpose as the local
establishments do daily for the banks which are
members thereof. Similarly, there is in London
an International Clearing-house through
which the National Clearing-houses all over the
world effect monthly clearances. Each city
bank takes an equal quantity of certificates in
its local clearing-house, so that when aid is extended,
no unfavorable inference is drawn; and
the same arrangement exists up to the International
establishment in London.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>The new noble metals Columbium, Africum,
Asium and Australium furnish coins ten times
as light as those of fifty years previous, while
very far exceeding them in wearing power. The
paper money extant being of equal value with
coin, is in universal circulation, while its cleanliness
and general good condition are insured by
frequent renewals; every bank of issue and deposit
being compelled by law since 1910 to accept
torn and soiled notes at par and replace
them with others, new, clean and whole.</p>

<p>In most mercantile and manufacturing establishments,
profit-sharing is the rule rather than
the exception.</p>

<p>Naturally a country so blessed in material and
moral wealth, would be the objective point of
the oppressed and unhappy from all over the
world; but there is in the immigration laws a
strict clause, carried out most rigidly, rendering
the possession of a certain degree of intelligence
and education absolutely a <i>sine qua non</i> for all
who wish to set foot upon our shores. The old
law by which contracting for labor abroad
was a punishable offense has been so far
changed that no one is permitted to land unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
possessed of means enough to support him for
three months without work, or having from a
responsible party a contract for his labor for
half a year ahead. Thus no paupers are thrown
upon the community, to be supported by either
the working or the leisure class.</p>

<p>The Government takes it upon itself, first to
prevent idleness, and second to furnish work to
the unemployed; so that there is no vagrancy.</p>

<p>In every city of importance, as well as in the
minor towns, the planting of trees on the streets
is compulsory; and if a lot-holder does not
plant and maintain on his street line the kind
and number of trees for which the laws call,
they are planted there by the local authorities,
at his charge.</p>

<p>Trial by jury was abolished in 1910 with
scarcely a dissenting vote; and instead of
ignorant or prejudiced juries, learned judges,
who hold their office during life or until impeached
by their peers, decide questions of law
and evidence. The statute law has been
greatly amended, and the common law superseded
by principles of equity.</p>

<p>The enactments concerning marriage and divorce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
are the same in all civilized nations, and
their enforcement most strict.</p>

<p>Only the physically perfect are permitted to
marry, and stirpiculture is made a common and
honored study. The local government being
responsible for the maintenance of cripples and
others physically as well as mentally ill, keeps
strict watch over health and morals. Surgical
and other hospitals are kept up at great expense,
and any one meeting with an accident, or becoming
ill, is treated at the hospital instead of
at home.</p>

<p>Elections are held in a quiet and orderly
manner; and the cumulative system having been
universally adopted in 1904, the minority has a
voice in proceedings of local, as well as National
bodies.</p>

<p>Female suffrage has taken the place of female
suffering. The education of the young is largely
confided to the direction of intelligent and refined
ladies, who consider their educational
duties as on a par with those which they owe
to religion proper.</p>

<p>The new generations, better educated and
better looked after than those which preceded
them, find at once fewer inducements to crime,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
and more reasons for not committing it; so that
imprisonment is not so common as formerly, and
execution is far more rare. Asphyxiation by
carbonic acid gas is the kindly and unrevolting
method chosen.</p>

<p>Trades unions flourish, but their basis is most
praiseworthy. The cardinal quality which
every member must possess is competence in his
trade. No one is admitted to membership in
any “degree” of the guild, unless he has been
properly instructed and proved capable and
competent to do what is called for by that degree
of advancement in his craft; and those of
the highest proficiency receive pay according to
the value of their services. Thus there is confidence
in and respect for the trade organizations;
and their members have some inducement
to excel in their chosen crafts.</p>

<p>In religion, there has been a fusion of the various
sects into a vast Church in which Charity
in its broadest sense is the leading principle,
and the golden rule inscribed upon the mental
tablets of all good people. A man’s religion is
deemed as of his inmost private life; as bearing
upon his confidential personal relations with his
God, and no more to be inquired into nor discussed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
than his most sacred domestic life.
Rancor and hatred engendered by religious differences
are of the unregretted past, and
mission-work, begun at home, and thoroughly
prosecuted with a view to physical improvement
and mental advancement, as well as spiritual
enlightenment, is carried to the heathen on the
wings of mercy and healing.</p>

<p>In these blessed days of 1943 each dweller in
a progressive community recognizes his duties
towards himself, his fellows and his Maker—acknowledges
his obligation to be charitable and
to contribute to the advancement of all about
him. They are halcyon days; they have
brought man nearer to himself, to his brethren—who
are all the world—and to his Maker, who
is everywhere and forever. They point, they
surely point, to further steps; to onward steps,
to upward steps; to steps which through swift-succeeding
centuries shall bring mankind nearer
and still nearer to divine knowledge, and make
him in each generation more and more nearly
the worthy, perfect image of an all-wise and
beneficent God.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Roger Brathwaite.</span></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>I read this prophecy through without stopping;
then gave myself up to the idea of the
great possibilities about to present themselves
to me. To be sole heir and executor of a property
so valuable as this arduous life-work must
be, should elate any struggling youth of twenty-two;
but to be the mouthpiece of prophecies
more wonderful, more far-reaching, more detailed,
yet more universal, than any ever before
given to the world, be they inspired or uninspired,
was enough to turn his head completely.
I drew mental pictures, far into the night,
limning myself as famous and rich; and incidentally,
the husband of Estelle; the father of
her children; the founder of a family which
should be known throughout the world as that
of him who unlocked the gates of time to come;
who pierced the depths of futurity; who controlled
that knowledge for the right to purchase
which the kings of finance jostled each
other.</p>

<p>I am ashamed to say that gratitude to Brathwaite,
and thorough appreciation of the fact
that he was the first to conceive and the first
to carry out, even in part, the idea of scientific
prophecy through graphical construction, took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
in my mind second place to the ideas of that
fame and fortune which were to be mine
through his industry and generosity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Midnight brought on the dusky hour</div>
<div class="verse">Friendliest to sleep and silence,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>but still I thought on, thought on. At last, tired
Nature asserted herself; I fell asleep in the big
chair from which I had in imagination seen the
magnates of the monetary world feverishly
awaiting, in my ante-room, my pleasure as to
how much information I would accord them, on
my own terms. I slept, to dream of dictatorship
of two continents, compelled by my exclusive
knowledge of the things to come; but while
I ruled as with a rod of iron the doings and the
comings and goings of both hemispheres, it
seemed as though war’s alarms sounded in my
ears—the rebellion of a nation from tyranny, be
it ever so mild, from dictation, be it ever so
wise. The clang of the multitude seeking relief
from the oppression of ignorance by knowledge,
rang in my ears; I started to my feet to
wake and find the fire-brigade jangling and
rumbling past my dwelling—the sparks from
the steamer’s stack streaming upwards and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
backwards in the black night as the great engine
thundered by.</p>

<p>To the west, a ruddy glow extended up
through the murky midnight sky, while lurid
flashes rose and fell in horrid alternation.
From time to time an angry flame arose, while
the harsh clangor of more engines speeding
through the almost deserted streets, gave greater
terror to the scene.</p>

<p>Fear filled my mind—I knew not why—lest
that awful holocaust should be the pyre of my
hopes and fortunes. Rushing from my room,
and spurred by anxious fears, I soon traversed
the distance between my home and the quiet
street in which for so many years Brathwaite
had labored in the accomplishment of his end
and aim—and for my great and ultimate benefit.
Hot though the pace, my heart thumped high
and hard against my chest, less from the unwonted
exercise than from anxiety lest the cup
of prosperity had been dashed from my lips
before I had tasted its contents.</p>

<p>My fears were but too well grounded. Tearing
past the blue-coated guardian of the peace
who sought to restrain me, I rushed to a spot
where without actual danger, I could best see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
the ruin which the fire-fiend was working to me—and
of course to Brathwaite—but how can
man, born of woman, feel more for his fellows
than for himself? Why affect a nobility not of
the nineteenth century? Why lay claim to
emotions which may belong to those to come—which
may have belonged to those gone by—but
not of the genius of this eager, selfish present?
True, I felt for Brathwaite; but for Ainsworth—for
Ainsworth again—and for Ainsworth still
again, the pity, the regret, the mad sense of
baffled ambition, rose ever up and obscured the
finer feelings.</p>

<p>The fire had gained the mastery over the great
building, before my arrival, and the principal
efforts of the firemen were directed to saving
the piano factory, with its stock of kiln-dried
lumber, of costly veneers, and of inflammable
varnishes. From that repository of so many
almost priceless volumes, so many absolutely
priceless charts, and of that Key which should
enable the possessor to avail himself of half a
century’s work by another—great sheets of
flame arose from beds of fire. Red sullen gusts,
“fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell,” bore on
their hurtling wings the treasures of a lifetime—bright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
upward-pouring golden torrents, wasting
mind and matter at furious rate.</p>

<p>Fierce though the heat, which seemed to crisp
my skin even at the distance at which I was
stationed, it was nothing to the hot welling passions
which assailed my inner self and drove
me to despair. That fury of a woman scorned,
than which hell no greater hath indeed, was
as nothing to a man so baffled in ambition,
which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent6">“hath one heel nail’d in hell,</div>
<div class="verse">Though she stretch her fingers to touch the heavens.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Demoniac rage possessed my soul—I was
frenzied to the verge of insanity, and as the
crash of that roof-tree which had shielded the
light of prophecy and covered my hopes, if but
for so short a time, sent scintillations up and
out, far and wide, I rushed from the excited
scene, I knew not whither.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I next recognized my surroundings, I
found myself in a small, neat room, white-walled
and curtained—and Estelle’s anxious
face was bending over me. I had been ill a
month, and my gaunt limbs and haggard features,
which I insisted on seeing in a mirror,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
gave no reminiscence of my once plump face
and rounded form. My voice, the mere ghost
of a sound, was hardly the semblance of its
former resonant self.</p>

<p>At first I was not permitted to excite myself
by too eager inquiry, but as I gained strength,
those about me, who of course had known nothing
about my intended collaboration with
Brathwaite, set to work to ascertain something
concerning the events of that September night
in which I had been so swiftly snatched up to
the seventh heaven of expectancy, and as suddenly
dropped to earth again.</p>

<p>There was nothing reassuring in the tidings
of a month ago. The enthusiast, roused from
slumber by the shrill cry of fire, sought to
save his papers rather than his person; traversed
passage after passage claimed by the invading
flames; and bore treasure after treasure
to the lower hall. But in penetrating to some
distant stairway, which gave way under his
daring footsteps, he inhaled flame, and although
rescued by the bravery of the firemen, was
borne from the seething, roaring furnace—only
to die.</p>

<p>So, then, the manuscript which the noble soul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
had entrusted to me, as an earnest of what was
to come, was all that remained of a life of work,
a fortune of expenditure.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Then black despair,</div>
<div class="verse">The shadow of a starless night was thrown</div>
<div class="verse">Over the world in which I moved alone”—</div>
</div></div>

<p>I could without a sigh “let the dead past bury
its dead,” but the future which promised so
much for me and mine—how could I bear to
give it up?</p>

<p>The attending physician, who gathered that I
had met with some sudden business reverse,
said soothingly: “Remember this line of Shakespeare:</p>

<p class="center">“‘Sweet are the uses of adversity,’</p>

<p>and this which Beaumont and Fletcher borrowed
from Seneca:</p>

<p class="center">“‘Calamity is man’s true touchstone.’</p>

<p>This trouble, great though it be, may be like the
heating in molten lead and quenching in cold
brine which gives to steel its greatest hardness
and most exquisite temper. Everything is for
the best.”</p>

<p>With this I could not agree. I am not sure
that I agree with it yet. I replied, peevishly:
“It is very easy for you to console me; to patch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
grief with proverbs. But I can quote you
Shakespeare against himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘’Tis all men’s office to speak patience</div>
<div class="verse">To those that wring under the load of sorrow,</div>
<div class="verse">But no man’s virtue, nor sufficiency,</div>
<div class="verse">To be so moral when he shall endure</div>
<div class="verse">The like himself.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Pope says, ‘I never knew any man in my life
who could not bear another’s misfortunes like
a Christian.’ While I do believe that I should
make the best of everything, I do not believe
that everything is for the best.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘Yet I argue not</div>
<div class="verse">Against Heaven’s hand or will, nor bate a jot</div>
<div class="verse">Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer</div>
<div class="verse">Right onward.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Estelle said, half-reprovingly, “‘If thou faint
in the day of adversity, thy faith is small.’”</p>

<p>“I never pretended to have faith. I never
thought that I had any, except perhaps when
none was needed. Faith is like courage; it
must be born in one, or be cultivated by contact
with danger. When there is no danger to test
one’s faith, there is no means of knowing
whether or not any has been born with one.
Then when faith is most needed, it may be
found entirely lacking.”</p>

<p>With such thoughts and words our conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
continued until the physician, mindful of
his patient’s physical welfare, signed to Estelle
to leave me—which she did, pressing on my pallid
forehead a soft, tender kiss that meant hope
and love, confidence and reassurance.</p>

<p>A soothing draught composed me to dreamless
sleep, and when again I woke it was to
see the love-light in my dear one’s eyes, patiently
watching my restful slumber and awaiting
my return to consciousness.</p>

<p>Her gentle ministrations, as much as the doctor’s
skill, restored health and strength to my
enfeebled mind and body. We tacitly avoided
the subject of my so-suddenly blasted ambitions,
and talked of love and happy life together, in a
pleasant uneventful future, such as had often
engrossed our conversation before my eyes had
seen from afar that promised land which I was
never to enter.</p>

<p>With returning vigor, I renewed my former
plans for my future and Estelle’s; but as my
steps increased in firmness, my thoughts still
reverted to Brathwaite’s wonderful prophetic
manuscript, some of the details of which I set
about to make realities of the present, rather
than of a generation hence. The hope of realizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
for myself and Estelle an early return
from my mental labors in their development and
embodiment, lent new strength, suppleness and
deftness to my touch, and seemed to make my
insight keener, my inventive powers more fertile,
more promptly responsive to the demands
upon them. <i>Festina lente</i> became my motto.
I doubted as I hoped; I criticised relentlessly as
I solved method after method, and produced
result after result. At each new step I felt the
ground firmly before trusting to it; I looked at
each production as though it were that of some
hated rival whom I had in my power to thrust
down, keep down, by savage search for faults
and merciless exposure of each weakness in design,
construction or operation.</p>

<p>The news of the dramatic death of Brathwaite
and some inkling of the fact that he had for so
many years been engaged in scientific research,
every vestige of result from which was believed
to have perished with “the old Professor”—as
the journals of the day styled him—had startled
the city; and gave three-column stories, spread
headed, sub-headed and padded <i>ad nauseam</i>;
no two agreeing, save that in all “the fire-fiend”
was rampant; “holocaust” and “pyre,” “cremation”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
and “conflagration,” vied with each
other in harrowing up the reader’s nerves. The
suburban press took up the strain in more subdued
tones and in less space, although no more
grammatically—while the far-away sheets of
Boom City or Dead Man’s Gulch paragraphed
it as the shocking self-destruction of Robert
Batterman, an eccentric metropolitan hermit
who had a mania for collecting old almanacs
and back numbers of periodicals. “Such is
fame,” said Byron, “to have one’s name misspelled
in the ‘Gazette.’”</p>

<p>The Masonic body of which Brathwaite had
been for so many years an unobtrusive member
announced a Lodge of Sorrow in memory of
the deceased brother; and most imposing were
the ceremonies, most impressive were the addresses
upon that occasion. From the pamphlet
account of this function, printed by resolution
of the Lodge, I excerpt the remarks of M.
W. Past Master Ashley, as showing in some
degree the respect in which Brathwaite was
held by those who knew him, and the veneration
which his upright life, his charitable although
retiring disposition, and his many and varied
accomplishments, inspired.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EULOGIA.</h2>
</div>


<p>“My Brethren:—</p>

<p>“‘Dear beauteous death, the jewel of the
just,’ has been laid upon the breast of him who
was and is in the Mystic Tie your brother and
mine; in every sense, the brother of all mankind.</p>

<p>“I have known him longer than the span of
most men’s lives, and though our paths have
been apart for many years, I have ever been
interested to know that his industrious life has
been kept unspotted from the world, and that a
heart large enough to include all who suffered
or were in want, a soul as white as heaven, have
ever been the tenants of his earthly habitation.
In youth pure and amiable, in vigorous manhood
wise, and steady, and just, a serene and
bright old age, lovely as a Lapland night, has
rounded out the earthly stay of Roger Brathwaite.
With him, high-erected thoughts, seated
in the heart of courtesy, were ever present.
While even in boyhood his thoughts and studies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
were what are called philosophical, he never
sought to help knowledge overthrow faith,
weaken hope, or lessen charity. His youth was
chaste and uneventful. That future then dawning
and which has become of the silent past,
was one of opportunities of many kinds for him,
favored as he was in health, in mind, in personal
appearance, in social position, and in this
world’s goods. He could have had a career in
which he would have been known and honored
of the multitude; but he preferred seclusion and
mental improvement to publicity and social advancement.
Yet at no time was his retirement
so complete as to shut out from him a knowledge
of the world’s on-goings and of the sufferings
and needs of his fellow-men; never did his
absorbing occupations close his ears to the cry
of the fatherless, or his purse against the appeal
of the widowed and forsaken. He craved
knowledge as the poet, the artist, crave fame;
yet the rich storehouses of his mind were ever
open to the inquiry of any earnest seeker after
truth.</p>

<p>“He loved mystery only that he might throw
its portals open to the light of day. ‘A gentleman
well-bred and of good name,’ honor sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
upon him as the sun in the gray vault of heaven.
He sought hidden knowledge that he might use
it for the good of men, and eventually make it
free as the wind. No covert enmity made him
a target; he had no foe but death, to whom he
has rendered quittance. He died in full puissance
of mind and body. The rude imperious
surge has carried him from us, but his bright
and shining memory remains. Could I but
wish him no better than he wished his fellow-men
of all degree, I would breathe naught but
blessings and good will.</p>

<p>“What the exact import of his life-work, so
suddenly, so unfortunately swept away by the
rude flood of fire, I know not; no one seems to
know. This only we do know, that he culled
from every flower of fact some virtuous sweets
of knowledge which he laid up for mankind’s
good use.</p>

<p>“He leaves no kindred, save that all men are
alike his kith and kin. No widow’s tears bedew,
no orphan’s sighs bemoan, his honored
grave; yet there is no lack of tears or sighs, for
strong men full of years must mourn his death,
whose life was all so full of tenderness and
good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On a grassy sun-kissed slope overlooking the
beautiful harbor of New York, a massive granite
cube bearing his name, and the dates of his
birth and death, covers the silent tomb of Roger
Brathwaite. Peace to his ashes no less than to
his daring spirit, which laid bare the inmost
heart of the dead past, and would have wrested
its every secret from all time to come.</p>

<p class="ph3">WHY THE<br />


“Grimshaw Catechisms”<br />

ARE SO POPULAR.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>The <i>American Steam Engineer</i> of New York, which is the
official organ of the rapidly growing American Order of Steam Engineers,
says in its issue of March 1, 1888:</p>



<p>“The peculiar hold which the Grimshaw ‘Practical Catechisms’ have on the constituency
for which they are intended is due to these facts: They answer at once any
question about any kind of a pump or a steam engine that the author could think of
or had ever had asked him; are absolutely scientifically correct; practically useful;
written in a clear, plain, popular style; up to date; free from hard words and mathematical
formulas. Each question is asked by itself and answered in full by itself,
thus saving the reader the necessity of wading through a whole book when he only
wants to know one thing, but wants to know that right away. The books are plainly
printed, liberally illustrated, of a convenient size for the pocket, bound strongly to
stand use, and in dark cloth not to show the dirt; are on hard paper to stand
thumbing; handy for instant reference; liberally indexed and cross indexed; and explanations
are concise, yet very complete. Their author is a favorite writer for the
scientific papers; is known to be careful, competent, original, practical, abreast of the
times, and able to tell what he knows. They can be drawn on for examination questions
by examining engineers who are handling candidates for license, and by examination
committees testing candidates for admission to engineering societies. They
can be used to coach for examinations by those about to be examined for license, or
for admission to engineering societies. They enable competent engineers to improve
themselves; help green men out of scrapes without mortification or exposure; prevent
accidents and hasten repairs; enable an employer to test a candidate for a job, thus
preventing his being imposed upon; and can be used to settle disputes between engineers,
as to the topics of which they treat. They describe the construction and
operation of every kind of pump; tell how to set up, connect, adjust and start every
principal pump in the market, supposing all the parts to have been separated and laid
on the floor. Most of the matter is copyrighted, and can be found nowhere else. In
case of any trouble, they save delay in sending for, or writing to, the maker or agent
of the engine or pump. They are marvelously cheap and have long been needed. If
there are any practical questions in the lines of which they treat which is not answered
in the latest editions, the author answers such questions free by mail, and embodies
such question and answer in subsequent editions or volumes. The advantages of this
feature, which is original with the author of these popular books, and (up to date) exclusive,
cannot be overestimated.”</p>

<p class="ph3">NOTES ON NEW AND PATENTED INVENTIONS.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>In the great struggle after new methods, processes and implements
that characterizes our day, and which is a principal factor in
our material progress, there is a constant rule of the “survival of the
fittest.” Opposed to this is the claim, sometimes put forward, that
the value of a patented invention is not so much in its intrinsic worth
as in the method of presenting and introducing it to the world, or to
a market. Both propositions are in a sense true, but with this qualification,
that “permanent” success always depends upon intrinsic
worth, and while a short success may be attained by a plausible but
faulty invention, the future is sure to regulate it to the place it belongs.
It is perhaps unnecessary to argue this. Everyone’s observation
will prove it.</p>

<p><b>CASSIER’S MAGAZINE</b>, an engineering publication,
gotten up in the same style and equal in every respect to Harpers’,
The Century, and Scribners’, has begun a series of articles about
“New and Patented Inventions.” Many important things are to be
considered in these articles, among them that of “added detail.”
This might properly come under the head of “operative conditions,”
because it involves maintenance and attendance, but may be made
more plain by quoting a remark once made in England by an experienced
designer and constructor of machinery. He said: “The great
art of designing machinery consists in leaving out parts and pieces.”</p>

<p>The articles will be written by John Richards, in a popular style
such as the ordinary inventor and the busy business man can have
time to read and understand.</p>

<p>Mr. Richards is President of the Technical Society of the Pacific
Coast, and editor of the journal “Industry.” There are probably
few engineers so well known, or so capable of expressing an
intelligent opinion on the various classes of engineering matters, as
is Mr. Richards. He has had many years of active and practical experience
in the manufacture of machinery, and as a technical writer,
and he is known throughout the world by engineers and manufacturers
as a man from whom an honest, conscientious, as well as capable
opinion can be obtained.</p>
